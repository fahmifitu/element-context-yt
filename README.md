### Details
This YOOtheme WordPress plugin available on GitHub introduces "Element Context" settings section to your existing elements. This feature allows you to control the visibility of elements based on several conditions. You can easily configure your elements to show or hide based on multiple rules, such as WordPress-specific locations such as the front page, blog page, archive, singles, search results, and 404 error pages. Additionally, you can control the visibility of elements based on language, custom post type archives and singles, taxonomy archives, and custom URLs. This plugin is particularly useful when you want to add multiple builder elements that you want to conditionally show or hide to widget areas such as top or bottom. For instance, you can use it to manage multiple footer elements, multiple before footer elements, or breadcrumbs.

Feel free to contribute for more ideas of rules.
